# Not Space Invaders
This is NOT Space Invaders.  Little game written in C for feeling out the language.

# Build
In a Windows command prompt run the 'shell.bat' which will run Microsoft 'vcvarsall.bat' to set up 'cl'.

Then run 'build.bat' to build the game.

# Run
Game will build to 'build/win32_nsi.exe'.  Run 'win32_nsi.exe' to play!

# Improvements
Render text and some UI features:
1. Scores
2. Reset after win or loss

Add more levels and enemies that actually shoot back.

Add sprites and overall better visuals.

# Handmade Hero
I learned C programming from the Handmade Hero live stream project here https://handmadehero.org/.
